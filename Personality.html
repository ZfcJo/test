<p><i> I think this personality test is quite accurate and trustworthy. It is utilized by the US Military and other large corporations. The result I got seemed quite close to my personality in general.
I was assigned the artisan trait. Those under this trait are impulsive, fun-loving, optimistic and spontaneous. All these traits i would apply to myself. </i></p>
