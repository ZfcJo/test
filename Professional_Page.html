<center><h1><u> My Vision </u></h1><center>

<font face= "Times New Roman" size="5">
<p><i> In the future, I hope to have a successful, stable career in either the Gaming or Technology field.
The jobs i hold an interest in right now are Game Developing/Designing, Software Engineering, and Professional/Competetive Gaming.
I hope to love and enjoy my job, as that is more important to me than the money i will gain from it. </i></p>

<center><h1><u> My Mission </u></h1><center>

<p><i> To get to that point, I am doing my absolute best in my studies at The University of Technology, Jamaica. 
I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computing. I plan to transfer to a Canadian University in 2022 to continue my studies, then find work.
According to my research, becoming a game developer takes quite a bit of experience and knowledge, 
so I will have to go through several smaller positions before I am able to get there. Until then, I will continue to study, do research on the industry,
and collect ideas and inspiration from different games, anime and manga.</i></p>
